# Gladiator Game

## Description of the project
This project is about creating a 3D fighting game inside an arena. To accomplish this task, we were 2 students : [William Perez](https://github.com/W1lliam) and myself.


## Couple of constraints we had to respect.
- We had 10 days to do to make a playable game.
- We had to use as least as possible the blueprint.
- The enemies had to be animated properly.
- Most of the assets were given except for the menu or the UI.

## GitHub Hierarchy
- Thanks the heaviness of the project (due the quantity of assets we used), it was not possible to add the entire project on GitHub.
  But it's still possible to consult the c++ files, or to download the build. __Warning__ to make the build functionnal, it's important 
  to extract the files inside "WindowsNoEditor/GladiatorGame/Content/Paks".

- It is possible to download the entire project or to consult the project's video on this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F0mqn1sgX4D_EMZpoGDXXCx8HsQcweL-).
